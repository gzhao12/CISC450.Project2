bash-3.2$ cat test2.txt
In this project, you will implement a client and a server
which use TCP to transmit a file from the server to the client.
Both the client and the server will run on the course VM
{\em cisc450.cis.udel.edu},
but they should be written in such a way that they could
conceivably be run on any two hosts, not necessarily the same.
For convenience, both the hostname and the server
port number may be hardcoded into both client and server,
but this should be done in such a way that they should
be easy to change.

The server starts by waiting for a connection request from the client. %printin

The client starts by prompting the user to enter 
%the hostname and port number for the server. 
%It then prompts the user to enter
the name of the file to be transferred. The client then sends a connection
request to the server.  After the connection is established, the client sends a
filename to the server. The server reads the file and sends it to the client in
a series of packets as described below. The client receives the file and stores
it with the name {\em out.txt}.
When the file transfer is complete, both the client 
A
B
C
DEF

G
H
and the server terminate execution.

The format of a data packet is shown in the figure below:

\begin{verbatim}
    <----------------- 16 bits (2 bytes) ------------------>
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                Packet Sequence Number                |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |              Count (no. of data bytes)               |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |            Data Bytes      |          ...            |
    --------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

Each data packet contains a 4-byte long header followed by a number of data
characters.  The header contains  2 fields, each of length 16 bits (2 bytes) as
shown in the figure above. You must convert the values in these fields
into the network byte order when they are transmitted, and convert them back to
convert them back to host byte order when they are received.


The first field of the header is called the packet sequence number. Each packet
transmitted  by the  server is  assigned a sequence number  starting with 1 and
incremented by 1 for each packet.  The second field of the header is a count of
data characters in the packet. This value must be in the range 0 through 80. If
the count is 0, then there are no data
characters in the packet.
